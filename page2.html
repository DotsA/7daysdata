      <h3>Mapping Empire</h3>
      <p>Cartography and American Imperialism in the Philippines</p>
      <p>President McKinley’s religious conviction about American empire in the Philippines putatively came after many nights of prayer. When “guidance” finally arrived, he realized that America needed “to help” the Filipinos, and his first order of business was to direct his head military cartographer “to put the Philippines on the map of the United States.”1 After McKinley went “down on [his] knees and prayed Almighty God for light and guidance,” the mission became obvious and  the  imperative  of  mapping  answered  the  president’s entreaty.2Maps facilitate the course of empire. By creating imag-ined landscapes, which, readers believe, arise out of a desire to represent the truth, maps epitomize an imperial logic. Cartographers distill the excesses of representation by ju-diciously  redacting  and  making  geography  legible.  Maps can be held in the hand, as if the world were available on a human scale; maps divide lands into tracts indicating pos-session,  through  the  double  act  of  naming  and  placing  a rational grid of knowledge over the location depicted; maps edit out that which interferes with their supposed subject; maps  enforce  an  ethos  of  total  and  complete  perception through  a  visually  mediated  ideology  of  what  the  reader conceives of as an axiomatic understanding; and, finally, maps, as J. B. Harley has so astutely observed, envisage em-pire through their formulation of “myths which would as-sist in the maintenance of the territorial status quo.”3 </p>
<p> The  flood  of  maps  available  to  Americans  that  attended  the  impe-rial  project  in  the  Philippines  is  significant.  Those  created  about  the Philippines during the early colonial period could be found in popular newspapers, magazines, academic journals, government sources, and at-lases. Historian Susan Schulten explains that the Spanish-American War brought “critical changes” to American “cartographic culture.”4 These documents appear to be innocent surfaces where the sole purpose is to provide the reader with information about the Spanish-American War, the Philippine-American War, or other facets of the early colonial period. However, by assessing these maps, and the cartographic imperative that incited their design and production, we can determine the role these im-ages played in the creation of American empire. Maps were a cartographic scape that helped instigate and further the objectives of American im-perialism in the Pacific. By analyzing maps found in the popular press, maps created by the United States military, and maps of Philippine bod-ies (done through photography, diagrams, and corporeal measurements) this chapter details how the visual power of delineation allowed Ameri-cans to create a visually based assessment of the Philippine colony.Philippine Legibility and the American Mass MediaIn January 1900 the World ran an advertisement for a new edition of The CenturyDictionary & Cyclopedia & Atlas (fig. 37). The strength of this new reference guide, according to the full-page advertisement, is the volume’s war maps. The copy explains how this presentation of battle cartography “enable[s] one to trace instantly the movements of every important cam-paign on land or sea, the routes of invading armies, raids, etc., placing and dating on the maps the battles, sieges and blockades not only of ancient and medieval times, but also those of the year just ended—and this without any complexity in the maps themselves.”5 In case the reader needed to be reminded about recent wars, the advertisement has enormous graphic representations  of  “Africa”  and  the  “Philippine  Is.”6  Thinking  outside the traditional borders of American nationhood became a selling point, and an atlas—a cartographic guide to other places—became a desirable resource; it rendered colonial locales by outlining their boundaries and explaining their importance in relation to American empire.The CenturyDictionary & Cyclopedia & Atlas, published in 1899, is a ten-volume set, and although this advertisement used the Philippines as a hook, the enormous project devoted only a few pages to the archipelago.</p>
