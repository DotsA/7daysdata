        <h1>Cultural Identity is described as part of someones self-perception as it relates to their nationality,
ethnicity, religion, social class and etc. Your experiences, beliefs and interests all contribute to
your cultural identity meaning when exploring the idea of cultural identity there are a wide range
sections to explore. My interest specifically lies with cultural identity as it relates to nationality and
ethnicity, how we see ourselves and our “cultures” and how we express that through our style,
work and lifestyles.

For me cultural identity is a cross section of all the things, I believe cultural identity is a result of
one’s surrounding and experiences. Having lived in Lagos, Nigeria, London and New York has
immensely contributed to my culture identity and the things I relate to and identify with. I believe
that an artists work is, to an extent, a reflection of themselves, their culture and their interests, the
idea of being able to depict culture while telling insightful stories that people can relate to is
something I always consider when building concepts.</h1>
