'60s Fashion: The Youthquake and Its Aftershocks
Wednesday, Mar 14 | 6:30 pm–8:30 pm
Museum of the City of New York, 1220 Fifth Avenue

In the tumultuous 1960s, fashion underwent a radical transformation from the styles of the straight-laced 1950s to clothes inspired by the cultural and societal changes that defined the new decade. This shift was spurred on by designers who launched new looks and paved the way for trends of the ‘70s onward. New York designers Andrea Aranow and Anna Sui explore how the ‘60s influenced their work with curator Phyllis Magidson and fashion historian Hazel Clark.

Skill-Building for Social Justice:
Dollar Bail Brigade & Bail System
Monday, April 9 - 4:00-6:00pm
Wolff Conference Room, Room D1103, Albert and Vera List Academic Center
6 East 16th Street, New York, NY 10003, Room D1103

The Bronx Freedom Fund envisions a society that humanizes instead of criminalizes. The fund restores the presumption of innocence by keeping clients with their families, at their jobs, and out of jail while they await trial. They work tirelessly to fight mass incarceration and the criminalization of race and poverty, and to end the cash bail system as it exists.
Advocates and organizers from Bronx Freedom Fund, Dollar Bail Brigade, and other groups working to address injustice in the prison industrial complex will visit The New School to lead a workshop focused on the workings of the inequitable bail system and how individuals can take action. This workshop is part of Lang Civic Engagement & Social Justice's Skill-building for Social Justice series, which partners with social justice organizations and activists across New York City to introduce New School community members to frameworks, methodologies, and practices they can implement in their own lives.
